# NullX (Accelerated) C++ Math Library
NullX is a C++ SIMD-optimized mathematics library made for use in graphics rendering and game programming.
The aim for the library is to provide a simple guide to SIMD optimization, while maintaining an efficient use of the 
CPU's hardware. Development will be done in phases, with each phase bringing major improvements to the speed and 
potency of the library.

## Phase 1 - Initial Architecture
- Functionality for Vector2, Vector3, Vector4 & Matrix4x4
- Commonly used functions (Clamp, Floor, Ceiling, etc.)

## Phase 2 - Quaternions & Documentation
- Implement the magic of Quaternions
- Document existing code (function headers)

## Phase 3 - SIMD Vectors
- Implement intrinsics for Vector2, Vector3 & Vector4 classes
- Basic documentation of new SIMD functionality

## Phase 4 - SIMD Matrices
- Implement intrinsics for Matrix4x4
- Basic documentation of new SIMD functionality

## Phase 5 - Final Documentation
- Finalize all documentation of SIMD functionality
